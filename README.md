A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates – you can only add or remove plates from the top. In a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed. This is commonly referred to as "push" (to add) and "pop" (to remove).
Stack has operation keys which includes push, pop, peek and isempty 

A queue is another linear data structure, but it follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Think of it like a line of people waiting – the person who enters the line first is the first to be served. In a queue, new elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
Queue has operation keys which includes Enqueue, dequeue, front and isempty
